# Interview_response_Analysis_Project
A project for analysing interview responses by determining sentiment with TextBlob, extracting key phrases with spaCy, and providing an overall quality assessment.
Task Description:

Prepare a Sample Dataset:

Create a text file containing transcribed interview responses.
Each response should be in a separate paragraph, representing different interviewees.
Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob:

Write a script that reads the text file and analyzes the sentiment of each response.
Use TextBlob to determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.
Output the sentiment for each response.
Key Phrase Extraction with spaCy:

Extend the script to extract key phrases from each response using the spaCy library.
List these key phrases alongside their corresponding response.
Overall Quality Assessment:

Develop a simple method to assess the overall quality of each response.
Combine the sentiment score from TextBlob and the relevance of key phrases to the expected answer.
Provide a summary assessment indicating the quality of each response based on these factors.
